-----------------WORLD-------------------
| IN THE YEAR 2008, SCIENTIST WERE EXPE-|
|RIMENTING WITH A NEW CHEMICALS IN HOPE |
|TO FIND A WAY TO ENHANCE THE HUMAN PHY-|
|SIQUE, DURING PHASE 1 OF THE EXPERIMENT|
|A TEST SUBJECT HAD ESCAPED BUT WAS SOON|
|CONTAINED, THE SUBJECT 0 WAS DEEMED TOO|
|VOLATILE TO CONTINUE TESTING, SO DISPO-|
|SING OF HIS BODY WAS WHAT WAS THOUGH TO|
|BE THE RIGHT CHOICE. DURING THE PROCESS|
|THE SUBJECT BEGAN RAPIDLY SPREADING A  |
|GAS SUBSTANCE THAT CONTAMINATED ALL OF |
|THE FACILITY, SOON IT SPREAD OUT TO THE|
|REST OF THE WORLD AND FORCED PEOPLE TO |
|LIVE ON THE UNDERGROUND. IT WASN'T LONG|
|UNTIL THE LIFEFORMS BEGAN TO INVADE THE|
|REFUGES. EVERYONE IS ON THEIR OWN NOW. |
